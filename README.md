# PokerAgent

An Ios implentation of Poker HUDs usually found being utilized in the online poker format.

## Concept

Users track the actions of every player at the poker table by recording one of four possible Actions(Bet,Call,Check,Fold).

Even without tracking bet amounts and revealed cards, PokerAgent can classify players as either too passive, too aggressive, or balanced in various situation.

Four large buttons representing each action can be easily tapped without looking at the screen, such that PokerAgent is not intrusive on the user's playing experience.

## Example

Suppose the user is interested in a very popular pre-flop statistic named VPIP.

VPIP ("Voluntarily Puts Money in the Pot") is quantified as how often a player bets in any capacity without seing the flop.

[MyPokerHoldemTips](https://www.myholdempokertips.com/hud-stats-vpip) states a VPIP for a tight-aggressive player may be within the range of 16-22%.

That is, the user can expose "leaks" in their opponents game play by identifying certain situations where the player is not acting in accordance to their previously established playstyle.

This kind of information can be leveraged to exploit gaps in other player's strategies or expose gaps in the user's strategy.

## Addressing Concerns About An Unfair Advantage

Most casinos in the US currently allow the use of cellphones and tablets while playing.

Every statistic provided by PokerAgent can be calculated with pen and paper or mentally. PokerAgent simply offers a more efficient method of taking such notes.

PokerAgent is not designed to help players cheat. In fact, PokerAgent requires a deep understanding of poker, and prior knowledge of statistics in order to be useful in any capacity.

PokerAgent does not tell players how to act, it simply aims to keep the player well informed. Making decisions based on this information is still entirely in the hands of the user.
